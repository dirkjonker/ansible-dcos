# Ansible DC/OS modules

This can be used to control DC/OS.

Requirements: [dcos-python](https://github.com/dirkjonker/dcos-python) package installed, e.g. `pip install dcos-python`

Note: this has only been tested with DC/OS 1.10. There are probably lots of bugs. Please report them on github, or create a pull request!

## Examples

Connecting to a cluster, note this will automatically refresh the auth token if it will expire in the next 60 minutes or so.

      dcos_connection:
        url: https://dcos-cluster.example.com
        username: sysadmin
        password: "{{ sysadm_pwd }}"
